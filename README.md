### NOTE: 
If you cloned this project and did not create your own framework then **skip** the *'Create a db.json file with 
some data'* step as this file already exists in this project. 

### ALSO NOTE:
If you cloned this project and go to http://localhost:3000/posts/1 as per the 
[JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) setup instructions, you'll see different data in the responses 
as my db.json file contains different data to the example data in the setup instructions.
